# Lovr sample: Point-and-drag

To understand the math better, I've made this simple sample project which
lets you point at objects, and then drag them so they follow the motion of your hand (while
staying at the same distance from before).

It also demonstrates parenting objects into a scenegraph, and converting between
the coordinate systems of the nodes in the graph.

It submodules the 'lovr-letters' project just to get the "Hand" class which I'm
quite fond of.
